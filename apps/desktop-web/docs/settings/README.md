# settings

The Settings page (`src/app/features/settings/`): appearance, language, notifications and the About
section.

In the desktop app, where device pairing is on and the session did not itself come from a pairing,
the Account entry is followed by **Approve web sign-in**, which opens the approval screen
([pairing](../pairing/README.md#approving-settingspairingapprove)). The browser's code screen names
this place, so the entry stays here.

## Appearance: text size and message density

Two reading preferences sit between Theme and Language, each a radio group (arrow keys move the choice),
with a preview of two sample messages that changes as the choice does. Both are kept in
`useAppearancePrefsStore` (localStorage, key `chatic-appearance-prefs`).

- **Text size** (small, default, large) sets the root `font-size` to 14, the browser's own base, or 17px.
  Everything is sized in rem, so the whole app scales, spacing included, not only text. The default
  clears the override instead of writing 16px, so a reader who changed the browser's base size keeps it.
- **Message density** (compact, comfy, spacious) sets `--message-row-py` and `--message-gap`, which only
  the message rows read (the padding of an author block and the gap between its messages). Comfy equals
  the spacing before the setting existed, and `styles.css` carries the same values as fallbacks.

`main.tsx` applies the stored values before the first render; the store hydrates localStorage
synchronously, so the app never paints at the default size first. After that a subscription in the
store applies each change.
